## Overview
### Description
RehApp (pronounced like Rehab) is an application where students may voice their problems and concerns about their mental well-being. Here, doctors and experts trained to identify and help people with mental illnesses can help students with their problems, provide advice, and potentially find a solution or a healthy option for the student. The users will be able to vent or voice their concerns by creating either a private or public post. The public feed can be seen by anyone with an account, while the private feed can only be seen by the creator, doctors, and selected friends that are given the permission to view it. There will be categories to which the user can label their posts under. Users are free to comment under different posts, chat with each other, and add other users as their friends as well. This application is geared towards students struggling with their mental health.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Mental wellness
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as Reddit or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile versions could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** This application would allow users to post about mental issues that they are dealing with, and allow trained professionals to comment and provide advice and potential solutions for them. The user can also message other users, comment on public posts, and befriend other users if they choose to.
- **Market:** This application is geared towards High School and College students. If the user is under 18, their age will be displayed on their profile.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as the user wanted depending on how much they would like to seek help, and how much they would like to interact with their friends on the application or view posts that they could potentially relate to and provide their own advice.
- **Scope:** First, we would start with just allowing any student to create an account, and this could potentially evolve into being implemented at different schools and universities.
